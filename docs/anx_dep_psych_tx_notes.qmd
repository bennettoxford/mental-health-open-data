# About this Document

This document summarises recommended psychological therapies for depression and anxiety disorders in UK general practice, drawing on NICE guidance:

- [Depression in adults: treatment and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/Recommendations)
- [Generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults: management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg113/chapter/Recommendations)

It also outlines how these therapies are coded in SNOMED-CT, using [OpenCodelists](https://www.opencodelists.org), a platform for creating and sharing codelists.

## Psychological Therapies for Depression

Therapies may be offered alone or in combination, sometimes alongside antidepressants, depending on severity, needs, and patient preference:

- **Guided self-help** – Printed or digital materials, often based on cognitive behavioural therapy.
- **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)** – Modifies thoughts and beliefs to influence behaviour; offered individually or in groups.
- **Behavioural Activation** – Identifies activity patterns affecting mood; develops strategies to reduce avoidance and improve mood.
- **Group Exercise** – Physical activity with peer support.
- **Group Mindfulness/Meditation** – Programmes such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to increase awareness of thoughts and feelings.
- **Interpersonal Psychotherapy** – Addresses interpersonal factors contributing to depression.
- **Counselling** – Supports emotional processing, coping, and problem-solving.
- **Short-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP)** – Explores difficult feelings in relationships and stressful contexts.
- **Individual Problem Solving** – Identifies problems and develops alternative solutions.
- **Behavioural Couples Therapy** – Resolves relationship issues linked to depression.
- **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)** – Uses controlled electrical currents to trigger brief seizures.
- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** – Uses magnetic fields to stimulate brain areas involved in mood regulation.

## Psychological Therapies for Anxiety disorders (GAD and Panic Disorder)

NICE recommends a stepped-care model, escalating from low- to high-intensity interventions based on severity:

**Low-intensity (first-line after monitoring):**
- Individual guided self-help
- Individual non-facilitated self-help
- Psychoeducation

**High-intensity:**
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
- Applied Relaxation – Teaches muscle relaxation techniques for anxiety-triggering situations.

## Coding of Psychological Therapies in SNOMED-CT

Preliminary review shows:

- Search terms for therapies such as CBT, Behavioural Activation, Exercise Therapy, Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and Applied Relaxation are **not diagnosis-specific** for anxiety disorders or depression.
- Codes are recorded across both **regime/therapy** and **procedure** categories.
- This means therapy coding patterns should be interpreted cautiously.

## Approach to Categorising Treatment Codes

For analysing code usage, therapy-related SNOMED-CT codes will be grouped into subcategories:

- Signposting/referrals
- Seen by psychologist
- Therapy started/ended
- Other/unspecified
- Low vs high intensity
- Indication-specific (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, or both)
