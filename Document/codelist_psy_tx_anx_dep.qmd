### Background

This document compiles the codelist of psychological therapies for Depression and Anxiety in the UK General practice. The codelist benefits from the NICE guideline recommendations on the management of anxiety and depression. Specific documents reviewed were:

-   [Depression in adults: treatment and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/Recommendations)
-   [Generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults: management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg113/chapter/Recommendations)

Furthermore, the NHSD codelists for anxiety and depression available on OpenCodelist were adapted. These include:

-   Depression support and treatment codes

-   Anxiety support and treatment codes

### Methodology

A two-step approach was taken for the development of this codelist:

**Step 1: Desk reviews of relevant guidelines and existing codelists for anxiety and depression**

This codelist benefits from the NICE guideline recommendations on the management of anxiety and depression. Specific documents reviewed were:

1.  **Depression in adults: treatment and management**

2.  **Generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults: management**

The recommended therapies outlined in the guidelines and existing NHSD codelists for anxiety and depression, available on OpenCodelist, were used in developing a draft codelist. The adapted codelists were:

1.  Depression support and treatment codes

2.  Anxiety support and treatment codes

**Step 2: A methodology-informed session with a General Practitioner** A methodology-informed session was held with a General Practitioner to understand the approach to coding psychological therapies in eHR. This informed the development of improved search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria.

**Inclusion and exclusion criteria**

This codelist is designed to maximize sensitivity by including all psychological therapy-related codes potentially applicable to anxiety and depression, regardless of explicit indication. Specifically,

-   Psychological therapies codes specific to anxiety and depression were included

-   Psychological therapies codes for conditions related to anxiety and depression (e.g Insomnia, bipolar disorder, psychosis) were included

-   Generic psychological therapies codes (e.g. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) not specific to other conditions were included

-   Common codes (based on GP's perspective) that indicated receipt of psychological therapies were included (e.g. seen by psychologists)

-   Psychological therapies codes specific to other conditions not related to anxiety and depression were excludedÂ
