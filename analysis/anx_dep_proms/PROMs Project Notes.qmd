# PROMs Project Notes

## Aims

To describe trends in coding of PROMs for mental health in English primary care, to inform future EHR research and facilitate integration of NHS Talking Therapies data into the OpenSAFELY platform.

-   Explore coding patterns for PROMs such as PHQ-9 (depression severity), GAD-7 (anxiety), and similar assessments

-   Investigate how frequently these measures are recorded, trends over time, and regional variation

-   Assess the feasibility of using GP-coded PROMs for large-scale mental health outcomes research

## Summary of NICE guidelines - Depression & GAD

### Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

-   Includes dedicated assessment and diagnosis pathway.

-   Recommends starting with 2 core screening questions, followed by GAD-7 if positive.

-   Offers structured steps for diagnosis and severity classification.

-   Emphasises use of validated PROMs (e.g. GAD-7) early in the process.

-   Better standardisation reduces variation across clinicians.

### Depression

-   Also includes screening questions (Whooley questions) but guidance is more implicit.

-   PHQ-9 is used only after clinical recognition to assess severity, not to detect cases.

-   Less structured diagnostic pathway means higher reliance on clinician judgment.

-   May lead to inconsistencies, especially where symptoms are culturally or individually atypical.

-   Guidance focuses more on treatment steps than on identification or assessment tools.

### Observations & Implications

-   Equity concern: Lack of standardisation in depression diagnosis could contribute to missed/delayed diagnosis in underserved groups.

-   PROMs are more clearly embedded in GAD guidance.

-   Both guidelines mention specific therapies: CBT, IPT, counselling, behavioural activation.

-   Monitoring, self-help, and stepped care approaches are referenced in both.

### Notes for Codelist Building

-   PROMs for GAD (e.g. GAD-7) have clearer clinical entry points.

-   PROMs for depression (e.g. PHQ-9) are mostly used post-diagnosis.

-   Psychological therapies and referral steps should be tracked as procedures.

-   Screening tools may be captured under observable entity or procedure hierarchies in SNOMED-CT.

## Summary of OpenCodelists Search

Search terms that returned no or poor results (PROM-specific):

-   PHQ-9
-   GAD-7

These terms didnâ€™t return any structured or complete codelists. PROMs are likely embedded under other terms or not curated directly.

Search terms that worked well:

-   depression screening
-   anxiety screening
-   depression
-   anxiety

These returned structured codelists containing screening procedures, PROM score codes, and referrals/interventions from sources like:

-   NHS Digital domain refsets
-   ONS mental health phenotype lists
-   OpenSAFELY phenotype projects
